# WFN_AM_Detection
Detection of wind farm noise amplitude modulation using Random Forest


To run the code: >>MainAMdetection

-----------------------------------
FFeature.m

SFeature.m

TFeature.m

TFeature_unweighted.m

a1_AM_detection_10sec.m

a2_AM_detection_10sec.m

a3_AM_detection_10sec.m

MainAMdetection.m

Mdl_best.mat

These are the MATLAB code files (.m) for Audio Feature extraction and AM prediction in: 

Nguyen et al. A machine learning based for detecting wind farm noise amplitude modulation, 2020

These files can be opened with a text editor to view, but require MATLAB software to run (http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)


Note that: The predictive model may need to train to get the best results!
